               <h2><b>The Beginner’s Guide to Learning the Guitar in 60 Days</b></h2>
               <p>Whether you’re young or old, there’s no better feeling than learning to play an instrument. While many attempt to learn the guitar, it is unfortunately very common for beginners to give up after only a couple of months. Guitar lessons with an instructor can be expensive and it can be frustrating if you’re not seeing progress immediately.
                
                In this article, you’ll learn about choosing a guitar, how to play guitar chords, how to tune a guitar, and how to hold a guitar. You can also find out more about the ChordBuddy guitar learning system which has shown great success among beginner guitar players of every age.</p>
                <p>
                  First things, first. Before you begin your journey of learning the guitar, you’ll need the instrument! While much of your decision will be based on personal preference, there are some key factors to consider when buying a guitar as a beginner guitarist:
                  <ul type="disc">
                  <li>Price</li>
                  <li>Style</li>
                  <li>Player Age/Size</li>
                  <li>Guitar Condition</li>
                  <li>Where You’re Purchasing</li>
                  </ul>

                  <br><b>Where to Purchase</b><br>
                  <br>As a beginner, it is best to avoid making a pawn shop, flea market, or yard sale purchase unless you are shopping with somebody who has experience in purchasing a guitar. Having never purchased a guitar, you may not know what to look for in terms of damage or guitar quality. With that being said, a local music retail shop is your best bet. You may also shop online with a reputable company, although be sure to review the business’ return policy.<br>

                  <br><b>Price of Guitar</b><br>
                  <br>While some suggest that a great guitar can cost you between $300 and $500, there are plenty of quality guitars available within the $100 to $200 range. Additionally, there are many “package” options that include not only the guitar, but also essential accessories, such as a tuner and gig bag.<br>

                  <br><b>Electric vs Acoustic vs Classical Guitar</b><br>
                  <br>Though this decision can be based on preference, we think the best guitar for a beginner is the acoustic guitar. Classical guitars have a wider neck, which can be hard for younger students or physically smaller individuals to handle when learning guitar chords. Meanwhile, the electric guitar is designed to be played with an amplifier, which comes at an additional cost. Acoustic guitars are simple and require little to no additional equipment, making them ideal for beginner guitarists.<br>

                  Condition of Guitar
                  There are numerous things to look for when purchasing a guitar. If purchasing a brand new guitar, these issues likely won’t be a concern, but they are worth checking for. Here are some steps to follow as you check the condition of a guitar:
                </p>
                
                <img src="tip1.jpg" class="tips">
                <p>1.) Slowly run your hand up and down the length of the guitar’s neck, as pictured below. 
                  <br>It should be smooth, with no sharp edges or splinters.<br></p>
                <img src="tip2.jpg" class="tips">
                <p>2.)Turn the guitar over and check its heel, as indicated in the photo below. 
                  <br>There should be no cracks or gaps between the guitar’s heel and neck.<br></p>
                <img src="tip3.jpg" class="tips">
                <p>3.)On the front of the guitar, check the bridge, as pictured below. 
                  <br>Run a thin pick between the bridge and the body of the guitar to ensure there are no gaps.<br></p>
                <img src="tip4.jpg" class="tips">
                <p><br>4.)Check the guitar’s string height by pressing down on the first, second, and third fret. You should be able to do so with minimal effort. Come to the 12th fret and press down. The distance from the top of fret to the bottom of the string should be no more than three times. 
                  If it is five times, the guitar may have a warped neck or too high of a bridge.<br></p>
